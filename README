>> Introduction

This crawler will take two passes. The first pass will crawl only the
post ID with a timestamp (the timestamp represents the "created_time").
And, the second pass will crawl deep into each of the crawl.

>> Control of Different Passes

The control of the passes is via index.php --
if you want pass 1, you should have:
// include "postsCrawler.php"; 
include "small_spc.php"; 

Otherwise, for pass 2,
include "postsCrawler.php"; 
// include "small_spc.php"; 

>> Transition from pass 1 to pass 2:

Pass 1 will produce a file named posts_<fbid>.txt. <fbid> should be the
user who performed the crawl of pass 1. For pass 2, you should rename
it as posts.txt only.

I have pre-crawled a few post ID files and I put them under posts_files
sub-directory. If you like to crawl, please copy one of them under config
and with the name posts.txt. Before you crawl, please make sure that you
remove the lastcheck.* file (otherwise, you won't be able to crawl from the
beginning).

The result of pass 2 will be placed under the outputs directory.

>> Coordination

Please contact me and make sure that we won't double-crawl.
